# RoomAcoustiC++ Documentation

Welcome to the official **RoomAcoustiC++ (RAC)** documentation site.
RAC is a C++ library for real-time room acoustic modelling designed for psychoacoustic research and immersive audio applications.
The library provides a simple API interface for controlling source and listener positions, room geometry and acoustic parameters.

## Quick start

* If you are building a C++ audio program you can integrate the RAC library into your own application that handles the appropriate function calls to the API.
* If you are a researcher or developer looking to use RAC you can use the provided Unity interface for efficient and simple control of the acoustic model.
