# Diffraction Modelling

In geometric acoustics, diffraction can be modelled using diffraction paths that travel from the source to the receiver via edges of the room geometry.

## Models

RoomAcoustiC++ implements multiple diffraction models.

- **Attenuate:** Attenuates the sound based on the length of the diffraction path. It is a simple model that does not consider the angle of incidence or frequency-dependent effects.

- **LPF:** Applies a 1st order low-pass filter at 1kHz to diffraction paths. It is a simple model that does not consider the angle of incidence.

- **UDFA:** The Universal Diffraction Filter Approximation[^1] uses multiple 1st order shelving IIR filters to model the low-pass filter response of diffraction paths.

- **UDFA-I:** A simplified version of UDFA that only models diffraction in the shadow zone.

- **NNBest and NNSmall:** Neural network-based models[^2] that approximate the frequency reponse of diffraction paths using a 2nd order IIR filter.

- **UTD:** The Uniform Theory of Diffraction[^3] (UTD) model implemented using a Linkwitz-Riley filterbank[^4].

- **BTM:** The Biot-Tolstoy-Medwin-Svensson[^5] (BTMS) model is a physically accurate model implemented using an FIR filter.
