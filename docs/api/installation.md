# Installation

Download the latest version of RoomAcoustiCpp from the [release section](https://github.com/jmannall/RoomAcoustiCpp/releases/latest), or clone the repository with the following command:
```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jmannall/RoomAcoustiCpp.git

To use the C++ library, add the RAC source and header files to your project and include the interface header file `#!cpp #include "Spatialiser/Interface.h"`.
This provides intuitive functions for interacting with RAC as outlined [here](../api/interface.md).
